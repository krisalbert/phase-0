#1.6 Your Website, part 1

**1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.**
(https://github.com/krisalbert/krisalbert.github.io)

**2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**
To create a new repository on github, first login to GitHub. After logging in, click the "+" button on the upper right of the site and select "New Repository". You would then need to type in the name of the repository, and an optional description (but a good idea). You can also choose to add a README which is recommended to do so. After filling out all the required data, click "Create Repository", and the new repository will be created in GitHub.

Just because we created the repository in GitHub does not mean that it has been created in our local machine yet. We need to do this by cloning the repository. To do this, open a terminal window and navigate to where you want the directory for the new repository to be created. Git will automatically create the directory for you when you clone, so no need to create this beforehand. On your browser, go to the repository you want to clone. On the lower right portion of the page, there is a link under "SSH clone URL". Copy this link.

Back in your terminal window, type `git clone [link you just copied`. This should clone the repository into your local machine.

**3. Describe what open source means. **
Open source mean that something can be shared, distributed and modified freely because it's source is available to the public. In terms of software, it means that the source code is available for anyone to see. There are different licenses that govern what kind of modifications are allowed to a particular source code.

**4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**
There are pros and cons to open source but I think in general, the pros highly outweigh the cons and for me. I understand why some parts of a source code must be kept proprietary in some cases but in most cases, opening up your source code and sharing knowledge with the community will in teh future make for possibly better features and also makes finding bugs faster.

**5. Assess the importance of using licenses.**
I believe this is very important when you want to share your code with the community. There are a number of existing licenses you may use although right now, I don't really quite understand the difference between each one and why you should use one in a particular case.

**6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**
No real "aha" moments because I had used git before. I definitely became more familar with git after doing these challenges. I also found out that you can host your site on github!

**7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**
I used Stack Overflow to read up on topics that was not as clear to me as they provide deeper discussion and examples.
