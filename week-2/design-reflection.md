**1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

  The 6 Phases of Web Design are:
  1. Information Gathering - The first step is to gather information, and often the mos important one as this is where you consider the Purpose, Goals, Target Audience and Content of the website.
  2. Planning - Based on the information gathered in step 1, this is the step where you plan how the site would be structured. This is the step where you would develp a site-map to guide your design and development.
  3. Design - This is where you come up with the look and feel of the website while considering the target audience, and creating one or more prototype designs for the website
  4. Development - This is where you create the website itself, transforming the prototype in (3) to a working website.
  5. Testing and Delivery - This is where you test whether all the functions are working as designed, and also test compatibility issues of the website with different browsers and different devices.
  6. Maintenance - Consistent update to the website with new content and most updated information.

**2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

The primary purpose of my site is to sell my skills as a developer. It should contain links to my portfolio and projects that I had worked on. The blog will give people a better idea of how I think and the way I work. It should also have a way for them to contact me.

**3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

Prospective employers would  probably be interested in seeing a sample of my work as a developer. My portfolio should and resume should provide them with information whether I have the qualification that they are looking for. The actual look and design of the site should also give them an idea of my skills.

Classmates or future DBC students would probably be interested in learning about my experience in the program, so they would probably be going to the blog. The blog should have a search function so that they can easily search for particular topics. Blog posts should also be categorized. They can also leave comments on blog posts.

**4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

Employers would probably look at my portfolio and resume and then contact me. Others would probably take a quick look at my portfolio and then head to the blog where they can leave comments or contact me if they have more questiobs.

**5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

Design is really about solving problems; design should have a purpose. You can design something that looks really beautiful but if it's really difficult for most people to use, then that will affect their experience of it and they will have a negative experience of it. Also, there is no one size fits all design, just because it works for one site doesn't mean that the design will work on another, and just because a user has a certain experience doesn't automatically mean that another person will have the same experience. The best thing we can do is design for specific experiences and promote certain behaviors but we can't predict the actual user experience.

**6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

User experience (UX) is how a person feels when interfacing with a system. UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.

UX design is valuable because it affects how someone interacts with your site. It doesn’t matter what your site  looks like if people don’t know how to use it. This experience will determine whether a user will keep coming back to your site or not.

**7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
I didn't really find any part of this challenge particularly tedious. I enjoyed learning about the design process and look forward to applying the concepts I had learned into future projects.
